meta-bin-deb
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of this openembedded meta is to create deb files of _applications_
with OE which can actually be installed and run on a deb based distribution.
This is done by "debootstrapping" the staging image from a deb repository and
linking against it.

These repositories are build against:
 - debian-jessie
 - raspbian-jessie
 - raspbian-wheezy

(The deb repository is not necessarily Debian based, an OE package feed can be used
as input as well, at least in theory).

To get started, a toolchains is needed. Instead of building it, the one supplied
by the host/distro is used, so it will be the same / compatible with the deb files.
The libgcc and libc are taken from the deb files themselves. For debian the host
cross compiler is used.

The machine config from OE is used at the moment, for the simple reason that
I don't know how to get it out of the deb repository.

https://github.com/victronenergy/venus is now used for building. The following
can be used to checkout the needed repositories: (or fetch instead of fetch-all
without victron git access)

make CONFIG=raspbian fetch-all

# this will update the generated meta layer
make bb
export DISTRO=raspbian-jessie
bitbake update-meta

Above creates the bitbake recipes to download and stage the deb files from the repository.
Loads of improvements can be made to it, but it is good enough to get things working.

Thereafter an attempt can be made to bitbake something as usual.

dependencies
------------
Note: qmake / moc from the host system is used and must be available!
e.g. sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev will install them (and more...)

The debian build relies on the host crosscompiler being installed
apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi

The `bitbake package-index` command requires reprepro to be installed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Ubuntu-14.04 the following can be added to local.conf:
include conf/local/use-host-tools.conf

to prevent building host tools (you do need to have the packages installed on the host
of course for it to work at all). And it will brick some recipes....!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
test program are in recipes-test, e.g. bitbake hello-from-qt should create a deb file
linked against qt....
