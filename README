meta-bin-deb
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of this openembedded meta is to create deb files of _applications_
with OE which can actually be installed and run on a deb based distribution.
This is done by "debootstrapping" the staging image from a deb repository and
linking against it.

For now I am fiddling with the raspbian/rapberrypi, which is a good candidate,
since it needs armv6 + hf instead of armel or armhf raspbian, but for Debian
you need armel and armhf support... Ideally there will be deb files created
for all of them for each distro version not EOL yet. (The deb repository is not
necessarily Debian based, an OE package feed can be used as input as well, at
least in theory).

Is this going to work at all? No idea, we will see! The applications I
intend to build don't have a lot of dependencies though. dbus, libevent, Qt
and python is used. The latter two are good candidates trouble...

To get started, a toolchains is needed. Instead of building it, the one supplied
by the distro is used, so it will be the same / compatible with the deb files.
The libgcc and libc are taken from the deb files themselves.

The machine config from OE is used at the moment, for the simple reason that
I don't know how to get it out of the deb repository.

script/create_meta.py creates the bitbake recipes to download and stage the deb
files from the repository. Loads of improvements can be made to it, but it is
good enough for now to see if this is a complete stupid idea, or can be made to
work (at least for myself...)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the raspberry I uses the toolchain from https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools

MACHINE = "raspberrypi"
TCMODE = "external-raspberrypi"
TARGET_OS = "linux-gnueabihf"
EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN = "/home/jeroen/software/raspberrypi/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64"
TARGET_SYS = "arm-linux-gnueabihf"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Ubuntu-14.04 the following can be added to local.conf:
include conf/local/use-host-tools.conf

to prevent building host tools (you do need to have the packages installed on the host
of course for it to work at all). And it will brick some recipes....!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
openembedded-core from https://github.com/jhofstee/openembedded-core/tree/jethro-bin-deb is used.
bitbake is 16bfd3e3d145705a2b3a05648ddbcacc7a338dfa

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
test program are in recipes-test, e.g. bitbake hello-from-qt should create a deb file
linked against qt 4.8.2....
